        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of David Bowie's life:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1947</strong> - David Robert Jones is born in the Brixton section of London to Margaret "Peggy" Burns and Heywood "John" Jones. The couple marry eight months later.</li>
            <li><strong>1964</strong> - Bowie's first band, Davie Jones & The King Bees, puts out its first single, "Liza Jane," but breaks up soon after.</li>
            <li><strong>1969</strong> - Four years after changing his stage name to David Bowie -- to avoid confusion with actor and future Monkee Davy Jones -- the 22-year-old releases his breakthrough single, "Space Oddity."</li>
            <li><strong>1970</strong> - In a BBC session, Bowie plays publicly for the first time with guitarist Mick Ronson, who would soon become the linchpin of backing band The Spiders From Mars.</li>
            <li><strong>1970</strong> - Bowie marries actress Angela Barnett, who would give birth to their son, Zowie (aka future film director Duncan Jones) in May 1971.</li>
            <li><strong>1972</strong> - Bowie performs "Starman" -- from The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars -- on British TV program Top of the Pops, which introduces the singer and his Ziggy Stardust persona to a generation.</li>
            <li><strong>1973</strong> - After a show at London's Hammersmith Odeon, The Spiders break up and Bowie retires the Ziggy Stardust character.</li>
            <li><strong>1974</strong> - Bowie leaves Britain. Though he would visit London, he never lives there again -- instead residing in Los Angeles, Berlin, Switzerland and the island of Mustique. He died a New Yorker.</li>
            <li><strong>1975</strong> - "Fame" -- the second single from ninth album Young Americans -- hits No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, giving the British artist his first U.S. chart-topper.</li>
            <li><strong>1976</strong> - Arrested with Iggy Pop for marijuana possession in upstate New York. The charges are later dismissed.</li>
            <li><strong>1983</strong> - Signs a lucrative contract with EMI, estimated at $17 million. His first LP for the label, April's Let's Dance, spawns three hit singles and a massive global tour.</li>
            <li><strong>1985</strong> - Bowie and Mick Jagger's high-camp video for their version of Martha & The Vandellas' "Dancing in the Street" is screened twice at the inaugural Live Aid.</li>
            <li><strong>1986</strong> - Jim Henson's Labyrinth opens to mixed reviews and disappointing box office in the United States, with Bowie co-starring as Jareth the Goblin King.</li>
            <li><strong>1987</strong> - His Glass Spider Tour kicks off, featuring a parasailing dance troupe and a giant arachnid, as well as guitarist Peter Frampton.</li>
            <li><strong>1989</strong> - In an attempt to distance himself from pop stardom, Bowie forms Tin Machine with guitarist Reeves Gabrels -- an abrasive four-piece that releases its self-titled debut album on this day.</li>
            <li><strong>1992</strong> - Following his 1980 divorce from Angie, Bowie marries model Iman Abdulmajid in a private ceremony in Florence, Italy. Their daughter, Alexandria, would be born in 2000.</li>
            <li><strong>1995</strong> - The first stop on a co-headlining tour with Nine Inch Nails receives hostile audience reactions. "I did like the combination, but my fans didn't," Bowie later says. "Bad luck!"</li>
            <li><strong>1998</strong> - Bowienet -- arguably the first musician-driven social media site -- launches, offering downloadable material (including tour recordings and access to the artist's journals) for a $20 monthly subscription.</li>
            <li><strong>2001</strong> - After the 9/11 attacks, Bowie opens the Concert for New York City with a stunning cover of Paul Simon's "America" at Madison Square Garden.</li>
            <li><strong>2004</strong> - A few days after suffering a heart attack backstage in Prague, Bowie plays the final concert of a 112-show global run in Scheesel, Germany. He never tours again.</li>
            <li><strong>2006</strong> - His last public concert takes place at New York's Hammerstein Ballroom, where he sings three songs, including a duet of "Changes" with Alicia Keys.</li>
            <li><strong>2013</strong> - On his 66th birthday, Bowie surprise-releases a new single, "Where Are We Now?" and announces an LP, The Next Day, launching a productive burst that marked his last years.</li>
            <li><strong>2015</strong> - Lazarus -- a stage production co-written by Bowie and Irish playwright Enda Walsh -- premieres at the New York Theatre Workshop.</li>
            <li><strong>2016</strong> - Bowie dies in New York, two days after his 69th birthday and the release of his 26th studio LP Blackstar.</li>
